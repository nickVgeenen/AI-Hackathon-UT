# How to run the project

The project uses React + Vite

- Install and open a code editor (Visual Studio Code is recommended: https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Install Node.JS (https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code (Terminal > New Terminal) and run 'npm run dev'. This should get you a link to open the file locally (e.g. http://localhost:5173)
- If this doesn't work you can provide ChatGPT some information about the project and copy+paste the error message.
